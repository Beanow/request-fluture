# request-fluture

Simple HTTP requests with [Flutures](https://github.com/fluture-js/Fluture) and [request](https://github.com/request/request).

This is a wrapper around `request` to offer a Fluture API (instead of callback- or promise-driven).

This is just a slight extension of a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/Avaq/e7083ffc7972bb1d4c88239b51eb4a79) by @Avaq.
